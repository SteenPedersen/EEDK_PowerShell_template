# EEDK_PowerShell_template
Example of a PowerShell template script which can be deployed and provide feedback to ePO using Custom Props.

Make sure to place both the .CMD and .PS1 in an empty folder and use the EEDK to select that folder.
This will create an ePO pacakge with both script files included.
